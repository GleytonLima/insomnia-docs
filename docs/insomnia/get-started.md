Insomnia is a free cross-platform desktop application that takes the pain out of interacting with and designing HTTP-based APIs. Insomnia combines an easy-to-use interface with advanced functionality like authentication helpers, code generation, and environment variables. There is also the option to subscribe to an Insomnia paid plan to gain access to encrypted data sync and team collaboration. 

If you haven't installed Insomnia yet, head over to [Install](/insomnia/install).
