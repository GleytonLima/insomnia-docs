Linting is enabled by default in Insomnia. As you type, Insomnia validates your specification in the background for issues. Errors are displayed via red dot on the left-most side of the code box. 

The Linter Panel displays at the bottom of the Editor contents. This panel aggregates all errors and warnings from the specification into a centralized location so it’s easier to get an overall sense of what’s going wrong without scrolling through and checking each individual line.
